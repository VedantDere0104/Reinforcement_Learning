# CrossEntropy Method :- 

Pytorch implementation of CrossEntropy Method on CartPole Environment .

Abstract :- 
The cross-entropy method is a recent versatile Monte Carlo technique.
This article provides a brief introduction to the cross-entropy method and discusses
how it can be used for rare-event probability estimation and for solving combinatorial,
continuous, constrained and noisy optimization problems. A comprehensive list of
references on cross-entropy methods and applications is included.
